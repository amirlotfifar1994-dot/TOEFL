At first, I noticed Café tables and chairs, Drinks/glasses, Plates and the way people were talking and laughing. Then I looked closer: their clothing (Casual urban clothing (shirts, jackets)) and their expressions made the scene feel social, relaxed, cheerful. After that, something small happened that changed the mood, and we had to respond quickly. In the end, we solved it, and the moment became a story I still remember.",
