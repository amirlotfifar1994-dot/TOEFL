For example, when I study in a calm space, I can organize my ideas and finish tasks faster. A possible explanation is that fewer interruptions reduce mental fatigue.

At first, I noticed Bus/train door, Street, People and the way people were stepping off a bus. Then I looked closer: their clothing (Denim shirt/jacket, Shoulder bag) and their expressions made the scene feel confident, positive, busy-city energy. After that, something small happened that changed the mood, and we had to respond quickly. In the end, we solved it, and the moment became a story I still remember.",

A woman steps onto a blue bus on a busy street, carrying a shoulder bag. اول Bus/train door، Street و People را دیدم و اینکه آدم‌ها چطور Stepping off a bus. بعد دقیق‌تر نگاه کردم: لباس‌ها (Denim shirt/jacket و Shoulder bag) و حالت چهره‌ها باعث شد فضا Confident، Positive و Busy-city energy به نظر برسد. بعدش یک اتفاق کوچک افتاد که حال‌وهوا را عوض کرد و مجبور شدیم سریع واکنش نشان بدهیم. آخرش حلش کردیم و همان لحظه تبدیل شد به خاطره‌ای که هنوز یادم می‌ماند.",
