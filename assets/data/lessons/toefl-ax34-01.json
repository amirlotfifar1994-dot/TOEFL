For example, when I study in a calm space, I can organize my ideas and finish tasks faster. A possible explanation is that fewer interruptions reduce mental fatigue. Overall, choosing a quiet environment leads to better concentration and less stress, which improves my performance."

At first, I noticed 2 backpacks, Mountain trail, Wildflowers/meadow and the way people were standing side-by-side. Then I looked closer: their clothing (Outdoor jackets (dark/navy and light/neutral tones), Hiking pants/leggings) and their expressions made the scene feel calm, inspired, enjoying nature. After that, something small happened that changed the mood, and we had to respond quickly. In the end, we solved it, and the moment became a story I still remember.",
