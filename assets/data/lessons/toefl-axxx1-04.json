At first, I noticed pastries, cookies, sweets and the way people were shaking hands. Then I looked closer: their clothing (casual sweater, white button-up shirt) and their expressions made the scene feel friendly, satisfied, trusting. After that, something small happened that changed the mood, and we had to respond quickly. In the end, we solved it, and the moment became a story I still remember.",

A customer and a vendor shake hands in a bustling market stall filled with sweets and pastries. اول pastries، cookies و sweets را دیدم و اینکه آدم‌ها چطور shaking hands. بعد دقیق‌تر نگاه کردم: لباس‌ها (casual sweater و white button-up shirt) و حالت چهره‌ها باعث شد فضا friendly، satisfied و trusting به نظر برسد. بعدش یک اتفاق کوچک افتاد که حال‌وهوا را عوض کرد و مجبور شدیم سریع واکنش نشان بدهیم. آخرش حلش کردیم و همان لحظه تبدیل شد به خاطره‌ای که هنوز یادم می‌ماند.",
