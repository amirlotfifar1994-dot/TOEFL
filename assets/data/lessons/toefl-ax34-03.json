For example, when I study in a calm space, I can organize my ideas and finish tasks faster. A possible explanation is that fewer interruptions reduce mental fatigue. Overall, choosing a quiet environment leads to better concentration and less stress, which improves my performance."

At first, I noticed Campfire, Acoustic guitar, Mugs/cups and the way people were sitting around a campfire. Then I looked closer: their clothing (Casual jackets/sweaters, Jeans) and their expressions made the scene feel cozy, happy, social. After that, something small happened that changed the mood, and we had to respond quickly. In the end, we solved it, and the moment became a story I still remember.",
