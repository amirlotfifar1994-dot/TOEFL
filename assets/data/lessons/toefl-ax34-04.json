For example, when I study in a calm space, I can organize my ideas and finish tasks faster. A possible explanation is that fewer interruptions reduce mental fatigue.

At first, I noticed 2 backpacks, Forest path, Trees and leaves and the way people were walking and chatting. Then I looked closer: their clothing (Backpacks, Outdoor hoodie/jacket (man: olive/green)) and their expressions made the scene feel cheerful, relaxed, connected. After that, something small happened that changed the mood, and we had to respond quickly. In the end, we solved it, and the moment became a story I still remember.",

A man and woman hike a forest path, laughing as sunlight filters through the trees. اول 2 backpacks، Forest path و Trees and leaves را دیدم و اینکه آدم‌ها چطور Walking and chatting. بعد دقیق‌تر نگاه کردم: لباس‌ها (Backpacks و Outdoor hoodie/jacket (man: olive/green)) و حالت چهره‌ها باعث شد فضا Cheerful، Relaxed و Connected به نظر برسد. بعدش یک اتفاق کوچک افتاد که حال‌وهوا را عوض کرد و مجبور شدیم سریع واکنش نشان بدهیم. آخرش حلش کردیم و همان لحظه تبدیل شد به خاطره‌ای که هنوز یادم می‌ماند.",
