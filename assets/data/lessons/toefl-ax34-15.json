For example, when I study in a calm space, I can organize my ideas and finish tasks faster. A possible explanation is that fewer interruptions reduce mental fatigue.

At first, I noticed Tent (orange), Campfire glow, Starry sky / Milky Way and the way people were sitting and looking at the stars. Then I looked closer: their clothing (Warm jackets, Outdoor pants) and their expressions made the scene feel amazed, peaceful, curious. After that, something small happened that changed the mood, and we had to respond quickly. In the end, we solved it, and the moment became a story I still remember.",
