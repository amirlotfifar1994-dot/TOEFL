At first, I noticed Kayaks (red and blue), Paddles, River rapids and the way people were paddling hard. Then I looked closer: their clothing (Helmets (red, blue), Life vests) and their expressions made the scene feel excited, focused, adventurous. After that, something small happened that changed the mood, and we had to respond quickly. In the end, we solved it, and the moment became a story I still remember.",
