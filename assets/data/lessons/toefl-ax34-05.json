For example, when I study in a calm space, I can organize my ideas and finish tasks faster. A possible explanation is that fewer interruptions reduce mental fatigue.

At first, I noticed River/lake, Rock ledge, Backpacks and the way people were sitting together. Then I looked closer: their clothing (Outdoor jackets and casual layers, Backpacks nearby) and their expressions made the scene feel peaceful, awe, togetherness. After that, something small happened that changed the mood, and we had to respond quickly. In the end, we solved it, and the moment became a story I still remember.",
