As a result, the mood is more organized than casual, which indicates that the moment is part of a routine rather than a spontaneous event."

For example, when I study in a calm space, I can organize my ideas and finish tasks faster. A possible explanation is that fewer interruptions reduce mental fatigue. Overall, choosing a quiet environment leads to better concentration and less stress, which improves my performance."

      "en": "Last weekend, I found myself at Lakeside campsite. Friends sit near a yellow tent by a lake, sipping from metal mugs as the sun sets. At first, I noticed Campfire, Yellow tent, Cups/mugs and the way people were sitting around a fire. Then I looked closer: their clothing (Casual outdoor clothing (t-shirts, jackets), Warm layers for evening) and their expressions made the scene feel cozy, friendly, relaxed. After that, something small happened that changed the mood, and we had to respond quickly. In the end, we solved it, and the moment became a story I still remember.",
