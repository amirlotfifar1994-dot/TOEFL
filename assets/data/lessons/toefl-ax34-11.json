      "en": "Last weekend, I found myself in Desert dunes. A couple sits on warm sand dunes as the sun sets over the desert. At first, I noticed Sand dunes, Backpack, Sunset sky and the way people were sitting close. Then I looked closer: their clothing (Man: light/gray t-shirt, Woman: green jacket) and their expressions made the scene feel warm, romantic, calm. After that, something small happened that changed the mood, and we had to respond quickly. In the end, we solved it, and the moment became a story I still remember.",

A couple sits on warm sand dunes as the sun sets over the desert. اول Sand dunes، Backpack و Sunset sky را دیدم و اینکه آدم‌ها چطور Sitting close. بعد دقیق‌تر نگاه کردم: لباس‌ها (Man: light/gray t-shirt و Woman: green jacket) و حالت چهره‌ها باعث شد فضا Warm، Romantic و Calm به نظر برسد. بعدش یک اتفاق کوچک افتاد که حال‌وهوا را عوض کرد و مجبور شدیم سریع واکنش نشان بدهیم. آخرش حلش کردیم و همان لحظه تبدیل شد به خاطره‌ای که هنوز یادم می‌ماند.",
