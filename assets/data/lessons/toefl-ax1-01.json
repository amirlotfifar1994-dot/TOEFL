Then I looked closer: their clothing (hard hats, safety glasses) and their expressions made the scene feel focused, professional, cooperative. After that, something small happened that changed the mood, and we had to respond quickly. In the end, we solved it, and the moment became a story I still remember.",

Two coworkers in protective gear review a checklist in an industrial workspace. اول tablet/clipboard، hard hats و safety glasses را دیدم و اینکه آدم‌ها چطور discussing a task. بعد دقیق‌تر نگاه کردم: لباس‌ها (hard hats و safety glasses) و حالت چهره‌ها باعث شد فضا focused، professional و cooperative به نظر برسد. بعدش یک اتفاق کوچک افتاد که حال‌وهوا را عوض کرد و مجبور شدیم سریع واکنش نشان بدهیم. آخرش حلش کردیم و همان لحظه تبدیل شد به خاطره‌ای که هنوز یادم می‌ماند.",
