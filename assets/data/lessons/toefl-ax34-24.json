For example, when I study in a calm space, I can organize my ideas and finish tasks faster. A possible explanation is that fewer interruptions reduce mental fatigue.

At first, I noticed Coffee cup, Shopping bags, City street background and the way people were walking and talking. Then I looked closer: their clothing (Woman 1: white top and jeans, Woman 2: light jacket over a floral dress) and their expressions made the scene feel happy, relaxed, social. After that, something small happened that changed the mood, and we had to respond quickly. In the end, we solved it, and the moment became a story I still remember.",
