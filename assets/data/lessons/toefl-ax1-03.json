In this setting (office conference room), focus on precise visual evidence before adding careful inference about intent or context. You can highlight actions such as presenting results; pointing to a chart and explain how they shape the interaction or outcome. Use specific nouns and modifiers for details like large screen; data chart to improve clarity. Tone words (for example: focused; serious) help your response sound natural yet academic.
