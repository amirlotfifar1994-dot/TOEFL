A lecturer explains a complex topic to students in a large lecture hall. اول chalkboard، chalk/markers و notebooks را دیدم و اینکه آدم‌ها چطور explaining a topic. بعد دقیق‌تر نگاه کردم: لباس‌ها (business-casual lecturer و casual student clothing) و حالت چهره‌ها باعث شد فضا attentive، serious و curious به نظر برسد. بعدش یک اتفاق کوچک افتاد که حال‌وهوا را عوض کرد و مجبور شدیم سریع واکنش نشان بدهیم. آخرش حلش کردیم و همان لحظه تبدیل شد به خاطره‌ای که هنوز یادم می‌ماند.",
