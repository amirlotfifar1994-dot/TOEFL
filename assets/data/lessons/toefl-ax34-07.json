For example, when I study in a calm space, I can organize my ideas and finish tasks faster. A possible explanation is that fewer interruptions reduce mental fatigue.

At first, I noticed Mountain lake, Rock ledge, Sunrise sky and the way people were sitting close together. Then I looked closer: their clothing (Man: green jacket, Woman: yellow hoodie/jacket) and their expressions made the scene feel romantic, peaceful, comforted. After that, something small happened that changed the mood, and we had to respond quickly. In the end, we solved it, and the moment became a story I still remember.",

A couple sits on a rock, wrapped in warm clothes, watching light over a lake and snowy mountains. اول Mountain lake، Rock ledge و Sunrise sky را دیدم و اینکه آدم‌ها چطور Sitting close together. بعد دقیق‌تر نگاه کردم: لباس‌ها (Man: green jacket و Woman: yellow hoodie/jacket) و حالت چهره‌ها باعث شد فضا Romantic، Peaceful و Comforted به نظر برسد. بعدش یک اتفاق کوچک افتاد که حال‌وهوا را عوض کرد و مجبور شدیم سریع واکنش نشان بدهیم. آخرش حلش کردیم و همان لحظه تبدیل شد به خاطره‌ای که هنوز یادم می‌ماند.",
