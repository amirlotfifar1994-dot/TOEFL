The father holds his child and reaches toward a container of small yellow citrus fruit, while the mother checks the display and keeps a shopping bag ready. Bright tomatoes, oranges, and leafy greens create a colorful scene, and the stacked crates suggest constant restocking and many customers. The child watches closely, which adds a warm family feeling to the routine task. After they decide what to buy, they will probably pay the vendor and continue shopping for the rest of their ingredients."
