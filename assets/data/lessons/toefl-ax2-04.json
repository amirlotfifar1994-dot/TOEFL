The strong red color draws attention to the idea of love, loss, and recovery. In this setting (outdoor city street), focus on precise visual evidence before adding careful inference about intent or context. You can highlight actions such as looking down; holding the torn heart and explain how they shape the interaction or outcome. Use specific nouns and modifiers for details like torn paper heart to improve clarity. Tone words (for example: sad; thoughtful) help your response sound natural yet academic. You will practice academic vocabulary and structured responses for TOEFL speaking and writing tasks."
