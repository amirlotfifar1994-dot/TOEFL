For example, when I study in a calm space, I can organize my ideas and finish tasks faster. A possible explanation is that fewer interruptions reduce mental fatigue.

At first, I noticed Ocean, Cliff, Coastline and the way people were sitting side-by-side. Then I looked closer: their clothing (Man: plaid/checkered shirt, Woman: light sweater/jacket) and their expressions made the scene feel peaceful, romantic, reflective. After that, something small happened that changed the mood, and we had to respond quickly. In the end, we solved it, and the moment became a story I still remember.",
