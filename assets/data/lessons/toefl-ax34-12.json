For example, when I study in a calm space, I can organize my ideas and finish tasks faster. A possible explanation is that fewer interruptions reduce mental fatigue. Overall, choosing a quiet environment leads to better concentration and less stress, which improves my performance."

At first, I noticed Smartphone (selfie), Backpacks, Lake and the way people were taking a selfie. Then I looked closer: their clothing (Outdoor tops/jackets, Backpacks) and their expressions made the scene feel happy, excited, friendly. After that, something small happened that changed the mood, and we had to respond quickly. In the end, we solved it, and the moment became a story I still remember.",

Four friends smile for a selfie on a mountain trail with a green valley behind them. اول Smartphone (selfie)، Backpacks و Lake را دیدم و اینکه آدم‌ها چطور Taking a selfie. بعد دقیق‌تر نگاه کردم: لباس‌ها (Outdoor tops/jackets و Backpacks) و حالت چهره‌ها باعث شد فضا Happy، Excited و Friendly به نظر برسد. بعدش یک اتفاق کوچک افتاد که حال‌وهوا را عوض کرد و مجبور شدیم سریع واکنش نشان بدهیم. آخرش حلش کردیم و همان لحظه تبدیل شد به خاطره‌ای که هنوز یادم می‌ماند.",
