At first, I noticed soccer ball, benches, laundry line and the way people were playing soccer. Then I looked closer: their clothing (orange T-shirt and shorts, striped polo shirt) and their expressions made the scene feel excited, playful, competitive. After that, something small happened that changed the mood, and we had to respond quickly. In the end, we solved it, and the moment became a story I still remember.",

Children play soccer in a neighborhood alley while others watch and cheer. اول soccer ball، benches و laundry line را دیدم و اینکه آدم‌ها چطور playing soccer. بعد دقیق‌تر نگاه کردم: لباس‌ها (orange T-shirt and shorts و striped polo shirt) و حالت چهره‌ها باعث شد فضا excited، playful و competitive به نظر برسد. بعدش یک اتفاق کوچک افتاد که حال‌وهوا را عوض کرد و مجبور شدیم سریع واکنش نشان بدهیم. آخرش حلش کردیم و همان لحظه تبدیل شد به خاطره‌ای که هنوز یادم می‌ماند.",
