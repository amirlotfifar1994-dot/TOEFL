For example, when I study in a calm space, I can organize my ideas and finish tasks faster. A possible explanation is that fewer interruptions reduce mental fatigue.

      "en": "Last weekend, I found myself at City viewpoint/rooftop. A couple stands on a rooftop, watching the glowing skyline as the day ends. At first, I noticed City skyline, Buildings, Sunset glow and the way people were standing close. Then I looked closer: their clothing (Man: denim jacket, Woman: beige coat/jacket) and their expressions made the scene feel romantic, hopeful, relaxed. After that, something small happened that changed the mood, and we had to respond quickly. In the end, we solved it, and the moment became a story I still remember.",

A couple stands on a rooftop, watching the glowing skyline as the day ends. اول City skyline، Buildings و Sunset glow را دیدم و اینکه آدم‌ها چطور Standing close. بعد دقیق‌تر نگاه کردم: لباس‌ها (Man: denim jacket و Woman: beige coat/jacket) و حالت چهره‌ها باعث شد فضا Romantic، Hopeful و Relaxed به نظر برسد. بعدش یک اتفاق کوچک افتاد که حال‌وهوا را عوض کرد و مجبور شدیم سریع واکنش نشان بدهیم. آخرش حلش کردیم و همان لحظه تبدیل شد به خاطره‌ای که هنوز یادم می‌ماند.",
