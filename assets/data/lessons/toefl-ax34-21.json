At first, I noticed Subway stairs, Railings, City buildings and the way people were walking up stairs. Then I looked closer: their clothing (Business suit, Dress shoes) and their expressions made the scene feel focused, busy, professional. After that, something small happened that changed the mood, and we had to respond quickly. In the end, we solved it, and the moment became a story I still remember.",

A man in a suit climbs out of the subway into a bright city morning. اول Subway stairs، Railings و City buildings را دیدم و اینکه آدم‌ها چطور Walking up stairs. بعد دقیق‌تر نگاه کردم: لباس‌ها (Business suit و Dress shoes) و حالت چهره‌ها باعث شد فضا Focused، Busy و Professional به نظر برسد. بعدش یک اتفاق کوچک افتاد که حال‌وهوا را عوض کرد و مجبور شدیم سریع واکنش نشان بدهیم. آخرش حلش کردیم و همان لحظه تبدیل شد به خاطره‌ای که هنوز یادم می‌ماند.",
