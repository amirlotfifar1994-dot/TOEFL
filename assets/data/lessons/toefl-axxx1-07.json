At first, I noticed smartphone, coffee cups, latte/cappuccino and the way people were taking a selfie. Then I looked closer: their clothing (headscarves (black and brown), denim jackets) and their expressions made the scene feel happy, relaxed, friendly. After that, something small happened that changed the mood, and we had to respond quickly. In the end, we solved it, and the moment became a story I still remember.",

Two friends smile for a selfie at an outdoor café table with hot drinks and a slice of cake. اول smartphone، coffee cups و latte/cappuccino را دیدم و اینکه آدم‌ها چطور taking a selfie. بعد دقیق‌تر نگاه کردم: لباس‌ها (headscarves (black and brown) و denim jackets) و حالت چهره‌ها باعث شد فضا happy، relaxed و friendly به نظر برسد. بعدش یک اتفاق کوچک افتاد که حال‌وهوا را عوض کرد و مجبور شدیم سریع واکنش نشان بدهیم. آخرش حلش کردیم و همان لحظه تبدیل شد به خاطره‌ای که هنوز یادم می‌ماند.",
