At first, I noticed Subway seats, Handrails, Smartphones and the way people were sitting/standing. Then I looked closer: their clothing (Mixed everyday clothes (jackets, shirts, backpacks)) and their expressions made the scene feel tired, neutral, focused on screens. After that, something small happened that changed the mood, and we had to respond quickly. In the end, we solved it, and the moment became a story I still remember.",

Passengers sit and stand in a bright subway car, many focused on their phones. اول Subway seats، Handrails و Smartphones را دیدم و اینکه آدم‌ها چطور Sitting/standing. بعد دقیق‌تر نگاه کردم: لباس‌ها (Mixed everyday clothes (jackets, shirts, backpacks)) و حالت چهره‌ها باعث شد فضا Tired، Neutral و Focused on screens به نظر برسد. بعدش یک اتفاق کوچک افتاد که حال‌وهوا را عوض کرد و مجبور شدیم سریع واکنش نشان بدهیم. آخرش حلش کردیم و همان لحظه تبدیل شد به خاطره‌ای که هنوز یادم می‌ماند.",
