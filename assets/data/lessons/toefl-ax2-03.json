The lack of eye contact and physical distance within closeness hint at communication breakdown. In this setting (home living room), focus on precise visual evidence before adding careful inference about intent or context. You can highlight actions such as sitting in silence; avoiding eye contact and explain how they shape the interaction or outcome. Use specific nouns and modifiers for details like couch; lamp (background) to improve clarity. Tone words (for example: sad; tense) help your response sound natural yet academic.
