In this setting (office / studio meeting table), focus on precise visual evidence before adding careful inference about intent or context. You can highlight actions such as reviewing blueprints; taking notes and explain how they shape the interaction or outcome. Use specific nouns and modifiers for details like blueprints/plans; laptop to improve clarity. Tone words (for example: concentrated; collaborative) help your response sound natural yet academic. You will practice academic vocabulary and structured responses for TOEFL speaking and writing tasks."
