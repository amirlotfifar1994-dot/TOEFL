At first, I noticed welding torch, metal pieces, workbench and the way people were welding. Then I looked closer: their clothing (blue coveralls, hard hats (blue and yellow)) and their expressions made the scene feel serious, focused, cooperative. After that, something small happened that changed the mood, and we had to respond quickly. In the end, we solved it, and the moment became a story I still remember.",

Four workers in hard hats focus on welding metal, with sparks flying from the workbench. اول welding torch، metal pieces و workbench را دیدم و اینکه آدم‌ها چطور welding. بعد دقیق‌تر نگاه کردم: لباس‌ها (blue coveralls و hard hats (blue and yellow)) و حالت چهره‌ها باعث شد فضا serious، focused و cooperative به نظر برسد. بعدش یک اتفاق کوچک افتاد که حال‌وهوا را عوض کرد و مجبور شدیم سریع واکنش نشان بدهیم. آخرش حلش کردیم و همان لحظه تبدیل شد به خاطره‌ای که هنوز یادم می‌ماند.",
