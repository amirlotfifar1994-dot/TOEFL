For example, when I study in a calm space, I can organize my ideas and finish tasks faster. A possible explanation is that fewer interruptions reduce mental fatigue.

At first, I noticed Flashlight, Backpacks, Trees and the way people were holding a flashlight. Then I looked closer: their clothing (Dark jackets, Backpacks) and their expressions made the scene feel anxious, alert, cautious. After that, something small happened that changed the mood, and we had to respond quickly. In the end, we solved it, and the moment became a story I still remember.",

A couple uses a flashlight to look for something in a shadowy forest. اول Flashlight، Backpacks و Trees را دیدم و اینکه آدم‌ها چطور Holding a flashlight. بعد دقیق‌تر نگاه کردم: لباس‌ها (Dark jackets و Backpacks) و حالت چهره‌ها باعث شد فضا Anxious، Alert و Cautious به نظر برسد. بعدش یک اتفاق کوچک افتاد که حال‌وهوا را عوض کرد و مجبور شدیم سریع واکنش نشان بدهیم. آخرش حلش کردیم و همان لحظه تبدیل شد به خاطره‌ای که هنوز یادم می‌ماند.",
