      "en": "Last weekend, I found myself in Downtown intersection. A large crowd crosses a wide intersection while taxis wait behind the line. At first, I noticed Crosswalk, Traffic lights, Taxis/cars and the way people were crossing the street. Then I looked closer: their clothing (Mixed urban clothing (jackets, shirts, backpacks)) and their expressions made the scene feel busy, fast-paced, urban energy. After that, something small happened that changed the mood, and we had to respond quickly. In the end, we solved it, and the moment became a story I still remember.",

A large crowd crosses a wide intersection while taxis wait behind the line. اول Crosswalk، Traffic lights و Taxis/cars را دیدم و اینکه آدم‌ها چطور Crossing the street. بعد دقیق‌تر نگاه کردم: لباس‌ها (Mixed urban clothing (jackets, shirts, backpacks)) و حالت چهره‌ها باعث شد فضا Busy، Fast-paced و Urban energy به نظر برسد. بعدش یک اتفاق کوچک افتاد که حال‌وهوا را عوض کرد و مجبور شدیم سریع واکنش نشان بدهیم. آخرش حلش کردیم و همان لحظه تبدیل شد به خاطره‌ای که هنوز یادم می‌ماند.",
