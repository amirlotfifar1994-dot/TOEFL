At first, I noticed hammer, chisel, metal tray and the way people were engraving. Then I looked closer: their clothing (dark work shirt, casual work clothes) and their expressions made the scene feel concentrated, patient, skilled. After that, something small happened that changed the mood, and we had to respond quickly. In the end, we solved it, and the moment became a story I still remember.",
